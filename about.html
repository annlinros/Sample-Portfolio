            <h4>About me</h4>
        </div>
        <p class="lead text-justify">
            I completed my bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Calicut University,India.
            Thereafter for a year,I worked in a Manufacturing company as an assistant PLC-programmer.And in year 2014, I relocated to Osnabr√ºck, Germany. 

            After completing my German language studies, I completed an advanced training in SIEMENS S7 PLC-Programming since i loved automation.Right after that I got opportunities from different firms,
            but I would have to travel within or outside Germany,which for me was not a practical option considering family. <br><br>
            Then as I was thinking about my next options, one day I happened to have a conversation with a friend, who is a software developer
            and she told me about the rising oppurtunities in software programming field.
            I figured since i like programming for electronics machines, I might also like coding.
            I went home and as I researched I was clear, Javascript is the language i wanted to learn and web development is where i wanted to begin.
            And ever since I created my first plain html page, I wanted to learn more. <br> <br>
